A potential solution to this challenge is data augmentation. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in generation which can facilitate data augmentation greatly. In this study, we focus on Chinese dialogue-level dependency parsing, presenting three simple and effective strategies with LLM to augment the original training instances, namely word-level, syntax-level and discourse-level augmentations, respectively. These strategies enable LLMs to either preserve or modify dependency structures, thereby assuring accuracy while increasing the diversity of instances at different levels.We conduct experiments on the benchmark dataset released by Jiang et al. (2023) to validate our approach. Results show that our method can greatly boost the parsing performance in various settings, particularly in dependencies among elementary discourse units (EDUs). Lastly, we provide in-depth analysis to show the key points of our data augmentation strategies.","tags":["Dependency Parsing","Natural Language Processing","Large Language Model"],"title":"LLM-Assistant Data Augmentation for Chinese Dialogue-Level Dependency Parsing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhuang Chen*","Jincenzi Wu*","Jinfeng Zhou*","Bosi Wen*","Guanqun Bi","Gongyao Jiang","Yaru Cao","Yunghwei Lai","Zexuan Xiong","Minlie Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1708646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708646400,"objectID":"5f88513c8c987af12a7f476a18bee432","permalink":"https://zzoay.github.io/publication/tombench/","publishdate":"2024-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tombench/","section":"publication","summary":"Theory of Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to perceive and ascribe mental states to oneself and others. Recent research has sparked a debate over whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a form of ToM. However, existing ToM evaluations are hindered by challenges such as constrained scope, subjective judgment, and unintended contamination, yielding inadequate assessments. To address this gap, we introduce ToMBench with three key characteristics, a systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities in social cognition, a multiple-choice question format to support automated and unbiased evaluation, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory to strictly avoid data leakage. Based on ToMBench, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ToM performance of 10 popular LLMs across tasks and abilities. We find that even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 lag behind human performance by over 10% points, indicating that LLMs have not achieved a human-level theory of mind yet. Our aim with ToMBench is to enable an efficient and effective evaluation of LLMs' ToM capabilities, thereby facilitating the development of LLMs with inherent social intelligence.","tags":["Theory Of Mind","Large Language Model","Benchmark"],"title":"ToMBench: Benchmarking Theory of Mind in Large Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gongyao Jiang","Shuang Liu","Meishan Zhang","Min Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1688860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688860800,"objectID":"a103aa6c68a21825b20db79d20dbf3f4","permalink":"https://zzoay.github.io/publication/acl2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Dialogue-level dependency parsing has received insufficient attention, especially for Chinese. To this end, we draw on ideas from syntactic dependency and rhetorical structure theory (RST), developing a high-quality human-annotated corpus, which contains 850 dialogues and 199,803 dependencies. Considering that such tasks suffer from high annotation costs, we investigate zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Based on an existing syntactic treebank, we adopt a signal-based method to transform seen syntactic dependencies into unseen ones between elementary discourse units (EDUs), where the signals are detected by masked language modeling. Besides, we apply single-view and multi-view data selection to access reliable pseudo-labeled instances. Experimental results show the effectiveness of these baselines.

Pretrained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and RoBERTa can benefit this task much, leading to state-of-the-art performance. The common paradigm of utilizing these PLMs is fine-tuning, in which a linear classification layer is built upon the well-initialized PLM network, resulting in an FND mode, and then the full model is tuned on a training corpus. Although great successes have been achieved, this paradigm still involves a significant gap between the language model pretraining and target task fine-tuning processes. Fortunately, prompt learning, a new alternative to PLM exploration, can handle the issue naturally, showing the potential for further performance improvements. To this end, we propose knowledgeable prompt learning (KPL) for this task. First, we apply prompt learning to FND, through designing one sophisticated prompt template and the corresponding verbal words carefully for the task. Second, we incorporate external knowledge into the prompt representation, making the representation more expressive to predict the verbal words. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that prompt learning is better than the baseline fine-tuning PLM utilization for FND and can outperform all previous representative methods. Our final knowledgeable model (i.e, KPL) can provide further improvements. In particular, it achieves an average increase of 3.28% in F1 score under low-resource conditions compared with fine-tuning.","tags":["Fake News Detection","Prompt Learning","Few-shot Learning","Natural Language Processing"],"title":"Fake news detection via knowledgeable prompt learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gongyao Jiang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

How-ever, few researches employ graph convolutional network for text classification, especially for short text classification. In this work, a special text graph of the short-text corpus is created, and then a short-text graph convolutional network (STGCN) is developed. Specifical-ly, different topic models for short text are employed, and a short tex-t short-text graph based on the word co-occurrence, document word relations, and text topic information, is developed. The word and sen-tence representations generated by the STGCN are considered as the classification feature. In addition, a pre-trained word vector obtained by the BERTs hidden layer is employed, which greatly improves the classification effect of our model.
